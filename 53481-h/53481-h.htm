<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>Having been associated with the printing telegraph for more than
sixty years, I have felt the urge to write a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the problems and
the progress made during my time toward today&rsquo;s wonderful achievements
in the art of telegraphic communications.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that of all the old-time electric telegraph
systems, it appears that only those using the Morse dot-dash code
invented in 1837 and the permutation code devised by Gauss and
Weber in 1833 (now known everywhere as the Baudot code) have
survived today.</p>
<p>Samuel Morse&rsquo;s code, which was modified somewhat in several letter
code compositions to facilitate its use anywhere in the world, has become
an audible, easily learned international language, loved by its users
everywhere. It will no doubt continue to be used for some time to come,
as long as we have our railroad telegraph operators, radio amateurs, police
CW systems, certain branches of the Armed Forces, and any others
who converse in dits and dahs.</p>
<p>The permutation code has taken hold firmly, too. Its use of five pulses
transmitted in varying combinations of on and off, or positive and
negative, conditions has wide application in today&rsquo;s printed communications
systems. As in the Morse system, alphabets for the five-unit permutation
code system have been modified as to letter code compositions for
international correspondence. The permutation code uses the powers of
two in progressively selecting a letter printing position.</p>
<p>The binary code uses the same selective stops by yes or no designation
in a system of counting by the powers of two. It is used where larger
groups of yes or no positions are required, as in data processing and
computer systems.</p>
<p>This writing, then, is a bit of history that will put together the constructive
developments that brought about the present era of the worldwide,
telegraphically-transmitted printed word.</p>
<p>I wish to acknowledge with great appreciation the informative
material sent to me by my friends, both here and in foreign lands, who
are associated with the telegraph industry.</p>
<p>For assembling information we have gathered from various sources
and for the most helpful assistance given me in writing this story, I also
want to thank my secretary, Mrs. Doris Pompilio.</p>

<h1 title="">PRINTING TELEGRAPHY ...
<br />A NEW ERA BEGINS</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER 1
<br />Introduction</h2>
<p>It is a major effort today to keep pace with the rapid advances in the
field of printed communications. Hardly a day passes that we do not read
of a new development in equipment that is more complex, farther reaching,
more rapid in operation....</p>
<p>This electrical, or electronic, transmission and interchange of the
printed word might be said to be an evolvement of the old printing telegraph
systems. Such systems, over the years, while not so rapidly as today,
were also improved upon, modified, speeded up, but could be used only
in the point-to-point transmission of messages.</p>
<p>While the railroads had been using the Morse code system (key and
sounder) satisfactorily, they would have preferred a system whereby a
printed record could be obtained. In the industrial world, too, there was
need for a businessman&rsquo;s printing telegraph&mdash;a means to type out messages,
directly and interchangeably, to far-off associates. And there was
always that dream, starting with the earliest telegraph experimenters, of
being able to correspond instantly with one another anywhere in the
world. Indeed, the need for all this had been known for many years, but
not the way.</p>
<p>It was after the turn of the century that telegraph engineers began in
earnest to think about a system of telegraphy that would permit direct
intercommunication by the printed word, and direct circuit connection
to any outlying subscriber as in the telephone communication system.</p>
<p>Up until then, apparatus for transmitting telegrams, such as that of
Wheatstone &amp; Cooke, Morse, Hughes, Barclay, etc., also the step-by-step
stock tickers and bulletin printers, used various types of code-signaling
devices in which the code varied in length as to the transmission
of more frequent or less frequent letters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>Now in order to provide a practical telegraph system permitting the
interconnection of apparatus throughout the world, the first basic requisite
is a standard signaling code; this code, moreover, must be of such
nature as to use the simplest form of electrical signaling (such as make
and break signals, or positive and negative signals), and the code should
be of equal length for all characters.</p>
<p>The permutation code, where combinations of five plus and minus
pulses will give thirty-two selective positions, was suggested as far back
as 1833 by Gauss and Weber. Whitehouse, in 1854, and Barnett, in
1860, experimented further, using the permutation code to operate a
recording mechanism. However, no practical means for actually printing
letters and figures was found until 1882 when Jean Maurice Emile
Baudot designed a multiplex system to permit the transmission of four
messages in each direction over a single line circuit. Later, Baudot designed
a tape printer in which the selecting and printing mechanisms
comprised an ingenious arrangement of cooperating parts, including a
rotating typewheel associated with a coded combiner wheel and five
stationary elements selectively movable to received code positions, each
element having an extending finger to be brought into contact with the
periphery of the coded combiner wheel upon the completion of a selective
code setting. When the code combination of the set fingers matched a
code on the wheel, a print roller was released to press the recording tape
against the typewheel and print the selected letter.</p>
<p>Although the Baudot Multiplex was used extensively in Europe, engineers
and inventors in the United States had not produced a practical
5-unit permutation-code teleprinter system. They were constantly searching
for a unit code system requiring a minimum number of electrical
impulses to operate a telegraph printer. Various types of relay systems
using distinctive signal pulses were proposed. A three-unit-code system
that showed promise, and did not require synchronism, used four different
electrical pulse conditions: a high voltage positive or negative pulse,
and a low voltage positive or negative pulse. Records show that many
inventors played with this code and that John Burry, C. L. Krum, G. A.
Cardwell, and J. C. Barclay, among others, built operable equipment
using such a code arrangement. The following excerpt from Cardwell&rsquo;s
patent No. 905,497 of December 1, 1908, may be of interest. It describes
the code arrangement of four different line conditions in three signal
groups to produce 36 different code combinations.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Cardwell&rsquo;s backers formed the American Telegraph Typewriter Company
and sold shares, claiming a great profitable future for their apparatus.
A few printers were built, but, on extended service tests, the high-low-voltage
feature proved to be impractical and the company folded.</p>
<p>J. C. Barclay of the Western Union Telegraph Company designed
printing apparatus and perforated tape transmitting equipment for this
type of system, but, after limited use of the high-low-voltage principle, he
changed this feature to long and short pulses with discriminating relays.
With later improvements, this system was put into service on a number
of Western Union message circuits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Note:</i> Today, in the 1960s, the techniques of frequency division and
electronics could be used for transmitting three different line conditions
from a group of four different frequencies. In such a system, synchronism
between send and receive terminals, or the start-stop method to control
correct timing, is not needed. The transmission of any selected group of
three, when received in succession at a teleprinter, will cause printing of
a letter when the third receiving relay completes a circuit to the selected
printing magnet. Transistor circuits with associated control elements could
replace the relays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Telegraph companies in the United States were mostly using the
Morse and increased its efficiency through development of quadruplex
operation and high-speed transmission systems. However, the quest for
a more efficient printing telegraph system persisted and various types
were proposed and tried. All made use of codes that were impractical for
intercommunicating systems and, while some were used in message service
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
by the telegraph companies, they did not appear to have any great
advantage over the Morse telegraph.</p>
<p>In 1911, Western Union began investigating systems used in Europe.
The first to be tested was the Creed, a system for transmitting and printing
Continental or Morse code signals at high speed. After observing
several other systems, the Murray Multiplex, an improved and modernized
version of the Baudot Multiplex, was found to show better operating
features and, due to the use of the five-unit permutation code, more
efficient use of telegraph lines.</p>
<p>By agreement with Donald Murray, and with his cooperation, the so-called
Western Union Multiplex was developed, using Murray&rsquo;s phonic
wheel drive and synchronous correction. Western Union engineers designed
tape transmitters and an autocontrol device for transmitting service
signals. A keyboard-operated, five-unit-code, tape punch was supplied by
the Morkrum Company. A page printer, which was later converted to
print on gummed tape, was supplied by the Kleinschmidt Electric Company.
The Western Union Multiplex was effective in increasing operating
efficiency and came into extensive use throughout the system.</p>
<p>From that time on, development of the Baudot permutation-code printing
telegraph apparatus was furthered by various companies, such as Bell
Laboratories, Western Electric, the Morkrum Company, the Kleinschmidt
Electric Company, as well as the companies of J. E. Wright, L. M. Potts,
and others.</p>
<p>It appears that all of these inventors experimented with the idea of
operating all transmitting and receiving apparatus at identical speeds to
transmit a five-unit-code combination by first transmitting a pulse to
start both transmitter and the distant receiver at the same time. Synchronous
operation was obtained by electric motors equipped with governors
to maintain correct speed; some used tuning-fork-controlled impulse
motors. A system of five relays with progressive contact arrangements to
cause cascade operation was also used to provide correct timing. Later,
when correctly-timed, 60-cycle alternating current became available (see
<a href="#Page_27">page 27</a>), synchronous motors did the job.</p>
<p>Teleprinter apparatus using this synchronous method worked very
well for point-to-point transmission as was used by the telegraph companies
and news-distributing organizations to carry local traffic. It did
not, however, solve the sought-for plan for a teleprinter intercommunicating
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
system. When attempts were made to connect printers at different
distant points in a telegraph intercommunicating circuit while using the
synchronous principle, false reception and printing errors would occur,
due to variation in line circuit conditions and to a variation of the mechanical
start operation at outlying teleprinters. This required frequent
overline adjustment to keep the connected apparatus in phase.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from a patent application of Dr. Louis M.
Potts (later to become research engineer for the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt
Corporation), filed June 17, 1909, giving his idea for achieving a teleprinter
intercommunicating system on the synchronous principle. Dr.
Potts was a very capable telegraph engineer. His early association was
with the telegraph system of the Rowland Telegraphic Company which
had limited use in the early 1900s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In those synchronous telegraph systems wherein the sending and the
receiving commutator brushes constantly rotate, it is necessary to adjust
these brushes so that they will approximately simultaneously engage
corresponding segments. To effect this adjustment there is usually provided
a special device embodying an additional segment on each commutator,
and the adjustment consists in causing the brushes to arrive
approximately simultaneously on this segment at the two ends of the line.
Such adjustment is known as &ldquo;finding the letter&rdquo; and has to be made every
time synchronism has been interrupted. According to the present invention,
the necessity of providing additional means for performing the so-called
operation of &ldquo;finding the letter&rdquo; is rendered unnecessary, since the transmitting
and receiving commutator brushes at the two ends of the line
start up afresh as it were for each signal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a later patent application, filed October 11, 1913, Dr. Potts stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This machine has also the advantage of being able to operate with a
very short code. In order to adapt it to Morse circuits, it should be capable
of operating with a code at least as short as the Morse code. In the present
machine, I preferably employ a five unit code which, together with the
starting impulse and the lag between signals, is actually shorter than the
Morse code. Counting the five code impulse periods, the starting impulse
period and the period of lag between impulses, each signal in my case,
may be considered in comparison with the Morse code as being seven
units long, whereas the Morse code is 8.5 units long. The average signal
being shorter than the Morse, the delicacy of adjustment will be less and
the distance of operation greater than a Morse telegraph for the same rate
of transmission in words per minute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Potts, however, still depended on like synchronous operation at
both terminals, and dual start, so he did not have the answer after all!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>John E. Wright, who in the 1890s designed and built step-by-step
printing apparatus, including the Wright-Negron bulletin printer, also
turned his thoughts toward the five-unit permutation code for printer
operation and built several variations using the synchronous principle.
The Superintendent of Telegraphs for the Delaware, Lackawanna and
Western Railroad thought well of Wright&rsquo;s apparatus and placed some in
operation. But, here again, reliable operation could be maintained only
in point-to-point operation. As will be noted in <a href="#c3">Chapter 2</a>, Mr. Wright&rsquo;s
patents were purchased by the Kleinschmidt Electric Company in 1922.</p>
<p>A paper issued by Siemens-Halske of Germany in January of 1917<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
states that the Siemens Pendel Telegraph &ldquo;is among the forerunners of
the eventual worldwide start-stop system for intercommunication by the
printed word.&rdquo; The following excerpt translated from that description
briefly explains the operation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pendel Telegraph uses the five-unit permutation code to select
characters, and operates on a start-stop principle. It is intended for station-to-station,
one-way operation, the line current normally being closed to
the positive side of the line battery. Transmission is under control of a
keyboard with keys arranged as in a typewriter. Upon the depression of
a key, the line battery is reversed, thereby transmitting a negative pulse
to line which effects the start of both transmitter and receiver at the same
time. Thereafter, five-code-combination pulses are transmitted, followed
by positive current to line, thus restoring the circuit system to a normally
closed line condition.</p>
<p>The name &ldquo;Pendel Telegraph&rdquo; would make one think that the timing
of the transmitter and receiver were under control of a swinging pendulum.
This is not the case. However, it does have a plan for simulating the
action of a pendulum by an arrangement of springs and semi-rotating
weights to effect synchronism for each printing cycle; and energy is derived
from a motor which intermittently winds a power mainspring to an even
tension. This arrangement is started in operation at both terminals at the
same time and provides isochronal motion at both transmitter and receiver
for each transmitted character. Due to multiple operations of the springs
and weights used to provide synchronous action, the operating speed is
limited to four or five letters per second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In England, too, there was work being done along these same lines.
Mr. H. H. Harrison, who is so well known for his contributions over the
years in the telegraph field, devised printer apparatus using the five-unit
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
code which is described in Herbert&rsquo;s <i>Telegraphy</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The instrument is provided with a Baudot 5-key keyboard, and has
a step-by-step distributor which is mounted inside the casing. The standard
Baudot alphabet is used, but each letter or character is prefixed by a
positive starting impulse. Every time a key is depressed a universal bar is
actuated which closes contacts giving the starting impulse and the distributors
at both ends of the line step through six spaces. The combiner
is of the electrical type invented by Baudot, and is similar to that used in
Siemens&rsquo; new automatic printing telegraph. Five relays of the class
used for telephone purposes are set at the receiving end, according to
whether some of the stepping impulses are positive or negative. The
distributor is a trunk hunting switch as used in automatic telephony, and
consists of a ratchet wheel and stepping electromagnet. On the shaft of
the ratchet wheel is fixed a wiper which sweeps over a semi-circular bank
of contacts in response to the stepping impulses. Two-way working is
secured by means of the differential balance.</p>
<p>(The article ends with the statement that a typewriter keyboard
is being constructed to replace the five keys.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that all of these telegraph engineers and inventors envisioned
a start-stop system and experimented with the idea of operating all transmitting
and receiving apparatus at identical speeds by inserting a start
signal before each group of letter code signals, to start both transmitter
and distant receiver at the same time, and a stop condition between code
groups.</p>
<p>In the following chapters will be shown the contributions made by
both the Kleinschmidt and the Morkrum companies in the printing telegraph
field, and finally their joint efforts which were to lead up to the
establishment of that now worldwide intercommunicating system, the
TELEX.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER 2
<br />KLEINSCHMIDT</h2>
<p>Edward E. Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s first direct contact with telegraph apparatus
was during his employment as a young man, in 1893, by John E. Wright,
whose firm had developed and was then manufacturing printing telegraph
equipment known as the Wright-Negron bulletin printer for the
Havas News Agency in Paris. These printers operated on the step-by-step
principle at 30 words per minute. (To attest to their ruggedness, as late
as 1951 some of these machines were reported to be still in use!)</p>
<p>Five years later, in 1898, Kleinschmidt started an experimental shop
at 122 Fulton Street in New York City. A sign over the door read, &ldquo;Inventions
Developed,&rdquo; and he did experimental and developmental work
for various customers (individuals as well as companies&mdash;including Western
Union) on a time-and-material basis. In the beginning he had a
project of his own going&mdash;a facsimile telegraph system. He submitted the
system to Western Union in 1900 with the suggestion that it might be
valuable for customer services, since a customer could write his telegram
in longhand and insert the written message in the transmitting unit for
transmission in facsimile to the telegraph central. The idea, however,
was rejected. At that time the photoelectric cell for scanning the written
message and electronic means for amplifying signals had not yet been
developed; while the apparatus operated quite well over short circuits,
evidently the time had not arrived for commercial facsimile telegraphy.</p>
<p>The first telegraph apparatus job for the shop was brought in by Dr.
George A. Cardwell, a dentist by profession. It was a partially developed
printing telegraph using a three-unit code made up of combinations of
plus-minus-high-and-low-voltage pulses (the code we have already discussed).
The work for Dr. Cardwell was carried on until 1903 when a
working model was completed. It had a typewheel for printing and stops
arranged in a circle; magnets under control of relay selection were used
to set the stops according to the received code combinations. This arrangement
operated well, and on a test over a Western Union circuit from
New York to Baltimore it gave satisfactory results. As we have seen,
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
however, the code arrangement proved unsatisfactory for general telegraphic
use.</p>
<p>Many customers came to the experimental shop with every type of idea
imaginable; vacuum cleaners (The &ldquo;Vacuna&rdquo;), elevator signals, some
early designs for Elmer Sperry&rsquo;s gyrocompass were only a few. Kleinschmidt
also set up a couple of side-line businesses, one for manufacturing
automatic fishing reels under the trade name &ldquo;Kelso,&rdquo; another, the Aseptuloid
Company, for making vaccination shields (some readers may well
remember their childhood vaccinations being protected by a bubble of
celluloid).</p>
<p>Another customer was George M. Seely, who later was instrumental in
bringing Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s work to the attention of Charles B. Goodspeed
and W. S. Moore (they were to become his financial backers&mdash;see <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>).
Mr. Seely came to the shop in 1906 with a partially developed
block system for electric trolley car railways. His plan was to use special
devices attached to the trolley pole which would cooperate with stationary
electrical controls at certain fixed points along the road.</p>
<p>After working along these lines for awhile it became apparent that
some inventive work would be required on Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s part. Seely, in
addition to time and material, then offered him a retainer for the assignment
of any resulting patents.</p>
<p>As plans and studies progressed, a number of railway signaling devices
were developed, tested, and patented. A major item was the development
of a telephone train dispatching system. A complete set of apparatus was
exhibited in operation at the American Association of Railroads Communications
Convention held in Los Angeles in 1910. The company
name given this venture was the &ldquo;National Telephone Selector Company,&rdquo;
located at 235 Greenwich Street, New York City. The telephone
train dispatching system was installed on the Long Branch Railroad with
30 stations connected with dispatcher headquarters at Red Bank, New
Jersey. Another installation was made on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
in West Virginia, connecting 38 stations with dispatcher headquarters
at Fairbanks, West Virginia.</p>
<p>Most of the patents assigned to Mr. Seely were eventually sold to the
Hall Signal Company.</p>
<p>Doing development work for others and assigning patents for a retainer
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
did not satisfy Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s ambitions. His interests being mainly in
the telegraph, he set out to design and build a piece of apparatus that the
telegraph companies could use. A keyboard-operated perforator to punch
the Morse code in a tape for automatic transmission at high speed looked
like a promising subject, since the tape punches in use at that time had
a three-key arrangement&mdash;one each for dot, dash, and space.</p>
<p>Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s first keyboard-operated, Morse-code perforator was constructed
in 1911 and exhibited to the Western Union Telegraph Company.
Mr. G. R. Benjamin, their chief engineer, and Mr. Emmett R.
Shute, a vice president, thought well of the machine and, after testing it,
gave Kleinschmidt an order for fifty. This order spelled success. To
celebrate the event, Kleinschmidt invited his brothers, Bernard, Fred and
William, and their families to a dinner party at a distinguished restaurant.
Soon thereafter (1913), the Kleinschmidt Electric Company was
organized, with the brothers as incorporating officers.</p>
<p>The Kleinschmidt Keyboard Perforator came into use by telegraph and
cable companies throughout the world where Morse, Wheatstone, or
Cable codes were used to transmit telegrams. It was also used with
Western Union&rsquo;s Barclay system which had its own code. The device
was later manufactured by Teletype Corporation under the name &ldquo;Teletype
Perforator&rdquo; and used by the U. S. Government where it served its
purpose for high-speed Morse transmission during the war period (see
<a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>).</p>
<p>In the years 1911 and 1912, the Western Union Telegraph Company,
in looking toward higher operating efficiency over their trunk circuits,
decided to test the Creed high-speed Morse and the Murray Multiplex,
and invited both companies to bring their apparatus to New York. It was
on this occasion that Kleinschmidt became acquainted with Mr. F. G.
Creed, who, upon observing the Kleinschmidt keyboard perforator at
Western Union, was impressed by its performance and said that there
would be a good market for it in England, especially as a keyboard
punch for the Creed high-speed Continental-Morse-code system. As a
result of that conference he asked for ten as a trial order. These perforators
were shipped to London in due time and gave satisfactory service.
The British Post Office Telegraph evidently had heard about this new
perforator and sent a letter to the Kleinschmidt company asking for a
demonstration at their London headquarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Now it happened at that time that Kleinschmidt was extremely busy
with the development of a five-unit-code typebar printer for the new
Multiplex&mdash;and this was urgent since the first model was to be put on
competitive test with a typewheel printer submitted by L. M. Potts and
the Western Electric typewheel printer which was then in use. Therefore,
he felt he should not lose a month or two in this developmental
work for a trip to London. So, his answer to this important invitation
was that he could not personally bring one of his perforators for exhibit
but that he would ask Mr. F. G. Creed to do so. Mr. Creed agreed and
set up a formal exhibit for the Post Office engineers; he consequently
received an order for twenty Kleinschmidt perforators. Further correspondence
with Creed resulted in an order for one hundred and a request
that Kleinschmidt come to London the next year (1914) to negotiate a
contract to supply his keyboard perforators for the Creed high-speed
Morse and to set up a sales agency with Creed for certain territories.</p>
<p>While in London in the summer of 1914, Kleinschmidt visited the
Managing Director of the Post Office Telegraph at his office to apologize
for having had Mr. Creed exhibit the Kleinschmidt perforator instead
of bringing it personally as had been requested. The Managing Director
replied that Mr. Creed had indeed given a very good operating exhibition
of the device and that an order for twenty had been placed with him.
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you know, we sent you an official invitation and
expected your appearance with your machine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To continue: Upon observing the change in systems at Western Union
(switching from the Barclay to the Murray Multiplex), the Kleinschmidt
Electric Company, who had been experimenting in the development of a
telegraph typewriter, built a receiving teletypewriter for the multiplex. It
was a magnet-operated, five-unit-code typebar page printer, using the
Underwood typewriter mechanisms as a basis; and it was completed in
time for test and evaluation at Western Union in competition with the
typewheel printers of both L. M. Potts and Western Electric.</p>
<p>The Western Electric machine was given the number 1A, Mr. Potts&rsquo;s,
2A, and the Kleinschmidt printer was 3A. The final outcome of the tests
was the selection of the Kleinschmidt model, and the company received
an order for five machines, to include a spare, to equip the New York
terminal of a New York-to-Boston, four-channel multiplex system. The
order was filled in a short time and the machines were put on test.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Kleinschmidt watched the operation of his machines in service almost
every day and was continually on the lookout for possible ways to improve
and simplify the apparatus. The tests ran through to completion satisfactorily,
and, upon submitting an improved design, numbered the 3B,
the Kleinschmidt Electric Company received an order for one hundred
typebar page printers. The 3B thereafter became standard apparatus and
additional orders were placed as the multiplex system at Western Union
expanded (see <a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>).</p>
<p>Several years later, Western Union efficiency engineers found that, due
to circuit failures, certain parts of messages would have to be repeated.
Because this meant retyping the message, they felt, and for other reasons
as well, that printing the received messages on tape would be more economical,
since corrections could be inserted without repeating the entire
message. To meet this requirement, the typebar page printer was redesigned
for printing on tape. This was accomplished by using the same
selection controls and operating the typebars to print downward on the
tape instead of upward against the platen as in the page printer. A tape
gummer to attach the tape to a message blank was also designed. The
21A, later No. 22, tape printer was ordered in quantity thereafter.</p>
<p>Seeing the possibility of using their typebar page printer for direct-line
service, the Kleinschmidt company built a motor-driven send-receive unit
having a single contact transmitter which operated under control of a
code-perforated tape to transmit seven signals in succession: one start,
five code, and a stop signal. The receiving unit had a seven-segment
commutator, one segment for start, five for code, and one for stop, and a
rotating brush to pick up and transmit the received code signals to the
printing unit. This apparatus was installed at the United Press for news
distribution to their connected newspapers. Another set was installed at
the Louisville and Nashville Railroad for station communications, and
still another in New York City at the Equitable Life Assurance Society
between their downtown and uptown offices. In connection with the
latter installation, the Equitable people asked permission to install the
printing apparatus on the telephone line and there was objection from
the telephone company. However, after some consideration they finally
agreed that the apparatus could be installed but warning that should it
create interference with the telephone line it would be removed immediately.
As it turned out, the printer operation over this telephone circuit
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
did not create any interference and the apparatus remained in service a
long time (<a href="#fig3">figure 3</a>).</p>

<p>The Kleinschmidt Electric Company now began to have financial difficulties.
Edward Kleinschmidt was borrowing wherever he could. There
was no large quantity production and evidently his charges for the apparatus
delivered were too low. At any rate, early in 1917, Mr. Seely suggested
that he get financial help to carry on and it was here that the
following gentlemen entered the picture: Charles B. Goodspeed of the
Buckeye Steel Casting Company; Paul M. Benedict, assistant to the
president of the C. B. &amp; Q.; Edward Moore, son of Judge Moore of the
American Can Company; Eldon Bisbee, a New York lawyer; and one of
Mr. Bisbee&rsquo;s clients, Albert Henry Wiggen, who was then president of
the Chase National Bank. With their financial backing, the company
was able to continue with further developmental work on simplified and
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
more efficient apparatus. Orders for various types of equipment for the
Western Union Multiplex and for the Morse code keyboard perforator
came along, but developmental costs were high and still more capital
investment was required; Kleinschmidt would then borrow from the
Chase Bank. Every so often at the Kleinschmidt company&rsquo;s directors&rsquo;
meetings, Mr. Holly, cashier of the bank and also a director of the company,
would state that the Kleinschmidt loan &ldquo;stood out like a lighthouse,&rdquo;
so a vote for an additional stock issue was carried and the loan
paid.</p>
<p>Along about 1919 the Kleinschmidt company had completed a satisfactory
keyboard-operated typebar teleprinter for intercommunication
systems (see <a href="#fig4">figure 4</a>). The Kleinschmidt Telegraph Typewriter, as it
was called, was installed at the New York City News, the Panama Canal,
and at the Brooklyn Union Gas Company (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>).</p>
<p>In 1922, Edward Kleinschmidt, having learned that Mr. J. E. Wright
had discontinued further developments in the telegraph field, proposed
the purchase of his patents, stating that this acquisition would broaden
the Kleinschmidt company&rsquo;s patent situation. The proposal was carried,
and, after negotiations, Mr. Wright&rsquo;s patents were bought for 100 shares
of the Kleinschmidt Electric Company&rsquo;s common stock.</p>
<p>In 1923, the Kleinschmidt Telegraph Typewriter was exhibited at the
20th Annual Business Show in New York and created a great deal of
interest. In 1924, a complete telegraph system was engineered and set
up for the Mexican government. (An engineer from Western Union
was borrowed to help with this job.)</p>
<p>One day, in 1923, after some correspondence with Samuel Samuel &amp;
Co., Ltd., through whom the Kleinschmidt company received orders
from Japan for the Morse code keyboard perforator, the Japanese Telegraph
Administration sent one of their telegraph engineers, Mr. Y. Okomoto,
to the company&rsquo;s headquarters to assist in working out a keyboard
arrangement of Japanese characters for a simplified alphabet consisting of
88 characters which the Japanese Telegraph Administration had devised.
The five-unit code could not be used since only 64 selective positions
could be had. So the telegraph typewriter mechanisms were changed to
six-unit-code operation, which worked out very well. The Kleinschmidt
company, and later Morkrum-Kleinschmidt, received continuing orders
for the six-unit-code telegraph typewriters.</p>

<br />KRUM AND MORTON
<br />(MORKRUM)</h2>
<p>Mark Morton, head of the Western Cold Storage Company in Chicago,
and cold-storage engineer Charles L. Krum, the vice president of
the firm, entered the telegraph field quite by accident. A young electrical
engineer named Frank Pearne, in 1902, had some ideas for a printing
telegraph machine and needed financial backing to carry on his experiments.
One of his contacts happened to be Joy Morton, the founder of
the Morton Salt Company. Joy Morton became interested enough to
become Pearne&rsquo;s backer, and prevailed upon brother Mark to set up a
laboratory in the attic of the cold-storage plant for Pearne&rsquo;s experiments.</p>
<p>It seems that after a year or so, Pearne lost interest in his invention
and went into the teaching field. He proved to be a very successful professor
at Armour Tech where he remained until his death.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> But Pearne&rsquo;s
work was not in vain, for Charles L. Krum had become intensely interested
and carried on the work with further inventions of his own. Indeed,
he filed his first patent application on August 20, 1903, which proposed
the use of a code comprising four signals: a positive pulse or a negative
pulse of low voltage, and a positive or negative pulse of a higher voltage.
Four additional patents were filed, the last in 1906.</p>
<p>C. L. Krum then set about building a machine which was demonstrated
in 1906 and looked promising enough to form a company to further
develop it. This company was made up of the Mortons (brothers Joy and
Mark) and the Krums (Charles L. and his son Howard who had just
finished college). The combination of their names, of course, resulted in
&ldquo;The Morkrum Company,&rdquo; which was incorporated in the State of Maine
on October 7, 1907. The charter stockholders were Joy Morton, who
shouldered the greatest financial burden; Charles Krum; Joy Morton&rsquo;s
secretary, Daniel Peterkin (he later became an officer of the Morkrum
Company); Mark Morton; and Sterling Morton (Joy&rsquo;s son, of whom we
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
shall be hearing more later on). The working capital of the new company
amounted to $150,000.00.</p>
<p>Charles Krum&rsquo;s son Howard, after graduation, joined with his father
in the developmental work of this new company and, due to his studies
in electrical engineering, was able to help his father considerably. His
first love and intended career was music, but he put this aside in favor
of his father&rsquo;s telegraph printer. However, a tune on the piano which he
always kept in the laboratory would help him solve many a difficult
problem.</p>
<p>In 1908 the Krums developed and produced a working model of the
four-unit-code, plus-minus, high-low-voltage system, which was applied
to operate the mechanism of an Oliver typewriter. The system was then
given an operative test on the wires of the Chicago and Alton Railroad,
of which Joy Morton was a director.</p>
<p>As their research work progressed, Howard studied the various systems
in current use and, with his father, decided to abandon the plus-minus,
high-low-voltage system. They turned instead to a system using the five-unit
permutation code as employed by Baudot in his multiplex telegraph
in which synchronized terminal apparatus with periodic correction was
the controlling feature.</p>
<p>Their first joint patent describes a plan for accomplishing synchronized
reception with transmission using a system of five relays interconnected
to operate in successive cascade form; thus, when the relays at both
terminals are correctly timed for successive operation, they will transmit
and receive the five pulse combinations of the Baudot code. For transmitting
and receiving the code pulses, each of the five relays has an
additional contact. To start the relay cascade operation, a start relay is
added at both terminals and operated by a start pulse which precedes each
code transmission. It seemed natural for the Krums to turn to a relay
system at first, since, from his work with the three-unit-code, high-low-voltage
system, C. L. Krum was experienced with the possibilities of
relay operation.</p>
<p>The system of the relay chain in cascade operation was employed to
operate a page printer using the mechanisms of the Blickensdoerfer typewriter
which had a three-row typewheel. The Postal Telegraph Company
became interested and bought a number of these printers in 1910. This
was the first sale of Morkrum apparatus and provided enthusiasm for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Krums for further research, which led to the substitution of a governed-motor-driven
brush distributor to replace the relay cascade system. For
this new plan the motor at the receiving printer operated at a slightly
higher speed and was held in continuously synchronous operation with
the transmitter by the periodic transmission of a correcting pulse. The
new code selecting and printer control system was also adapted to operate
the mechanism of the Blickensdoerfer typewheel typewriter. The idea
worked out better than the cascade relay system, and a number of printers
using this method were constructed and named the &ldquo;Morkrum Blue
Code.&rdquo; A few were put in service at the Postal Telegraph Company.</p>
<p>The Associated Press (AP) became interested in the Morkrum &ldquo;Blue
Code&rdquo; printer system as a replacement for the low-speed Morse system
which was being used to transmit news items to newspapers in many
cities. Here, continuous transmission under control of a code-punched
tape, as used in the Morse code system, was a requirement, so Messrs.
Krum set to work and designed a keyboard-operated, five-unit, Baudot-code
perforator and an automatic punched-tape-controlled transmitter.
This apparatus was installed at the New York headquarters in 1915 and
receiving printers were gradually installed throughout the Associated
Press system. The following excerpt and picture (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) from Oliver
Gramling&rsquo;s book, <i>AP&mdash;The Story of News</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> describes the introduction
of the system to the Associated Press:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tide of news by telegraph had continued with the years. Facilities
had been improved, the Morse clicked into virtually every town in the
country, but the old method was the same. Day in and day out, sending
operators took dispatches, translated them into the dash-dot of code, and
the telegraph keys sent the signals on the circuits at a rate of twenty-five
to thirty-five words a minute. In member newspaper offices along the line
the Morse sounders clack-clacked busily and receiving operators translated
the code symbols back into words, copying the stories in jerky spurts.
The news of more than half a century had been handled that way.</p>
<p>For some time, however, Charles L. Krum, a Chicago cold-storage
engineer, and his son Howard had been working to perfect an automatic
machine which would send the printed word by wire at greater speed
without the intermediary of code. They called their invention the Morkrum
Telegraph Printer&mdash;coining the word Morkrum by combining the inventor&rsquo;s
name with the first syllable in the last name of Joy Morton, a
Chicago businessman who financed them.</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Several other automatic telegraphic devices were being promoted, but
(Kent) Cooper and engineers in the Traffic Department decided
Krum&rsquo;s machine held the most promise for their purposes. Tests got under
way. In the Associated Press headquarters, which had been moved seven
blocks from the old Western Union building to 51 Chambers Street, a
sending operator sat at a keyboard similar to that of an ordinary typewriter.
As he struck the keys, copying the dispatches before him, the machine
perforated a paper tape with a series of holes, each combination representing
a letter. The tape fed into a box-like transmitter which transformed
the tape perforations into electrical impulses and sent them along the wires
into the receiving machines in newspaper offices. These impulses actuated
telegraph relays and set the receiving Morkrum machines automatically
reproducing the letters which the sending operators were typing miles away.</p>
<p>The tests demonstrated that the Morkrum could transmit news hour
after hour at the rate of sixty words a minute and the copy was delivered
clean and uniform. Thus began the slow extension of Morkrum transmission
to the whole leased wire system, replacing the &ldquo;brass pounding&rdquo;
Morse keys. It was a transition that required years and until it was completed
both Morse and Morkrum worked side by side in many places.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting story appeared recently in &ldquo;The AP World,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> giving
some recollections of AP&rsquo;s first field maintenance man, Royal (Roy)
Bailey, then aged 71 and living in retirement in California. He still remembers
the AP&rsquo;s first printing telegraph machines, the article says; in
fact, he helped make them, for he was a mechanic in the Morkrum
Company&rsquo;s factory in Chicago. When the Morkrum Company shipped
the first machines to AP headquarters, Bailey went along with the machines
to install and maintain them, although he remained on the Morkrum
Company&rsquo;s payroll. He eventually installed AP printers all over
New York City and Connecticut, in Newark, Philadelphia, Baltimore
and Washington, and in Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City. He recalls
that Morse telegraphers &ldquo;used to groan when they first saw him.&rdquo; The
early teleprinters were hard to keep synchronized, Bailey further recalls,
and copy boys had to check the speed frequently by sighting the striped
motor flywheel through a tuning fork. (Many of those copy boys, he says,
including Mickey Burt and Henry Elling, became AP engineers.)</p>
<p>As the experimental and developmental work continued at the Morkrum
plant, Howard Krum studied all types of start-stop systems and found
that synchronous control was the basis of all systems. After experimenting
with various ideas his thoughts turned to a plan to make the start of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
receiving unit somewhat independent of the transmitting unit start, thus
avoiding irregularities then present in transmitter start devices. This idea
led to the construction of a permutation-code, start-stop system, using
segmented commutators with rotating brush distributors at both transmitting
and receiving units and a start magnet for each to control start-stop
operation.</p>
<p>In this system the transmitter start magnet, when energized, releases
the transmitting brush, which immediately contacts the first segment to
transmit a start pulse to operate the receiver start magnet; the five-unit-code
signal combination follows and both transmitting and receiving units
are stopped. The apparatus was applied to control the selecting and printing
mechanism of the Blickensdoerfer typewheel typewriter and named
the &ldquo;Morkrum Green Code.&rdquo; This improved apparatus soon replaced the
Blue Code printer at Associated Press and other installations (see figs.
<a href="#fig7">7</a> and <a href="#fig7A">7A</a>).</p>
<p>In this connection the following additional comments of Mr. Bailey
may be of interest:<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1919 I installed the New York-Washington circuit, with drops at
Philadelphia and Baltimore. This was a new type of printer using what
we called the Green Code. This was considered an improvement over the
old Blue Code, which meant a rearrangement of the receiving mechanism,
but still the machines made use of a typewheel....</p>
<p>Our biggest job of all came in 1923 when we changed over all the
old Blue Code typewheel printers in the New York area to the new style
L. C. Smith typebar printers using Green Code. (Morkrum bought L. C.
Smith typewriters and added new machinery to them. Those printers became
the famous Model 12.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we have seen, a number of inventors had patented ways and means
to adopt the five-unit code for operating a telegraph printer system by
the transmission of a start pulse to start both transmitting apparatus and
the distant receiving apparatus at the same time, followed by transmission
of a selected code and a stop pulse. To achieve successful operation, very
close speed adjustment was required. At first, this was achieved by the
use of governed motors and, later, when accurately timed, 60-cycle alternating
current became available, the problem of synchronous operation
of send and receive stations was solved by the use of synchronous motors.</p>

<p>Telegraph printer systems of this type were used by telegraph companies
for city-to-city transmission of telegrams and by news-gathering
and -distributing organizations to transmit the news from headquarters
to newspapers in different cities. While start-stop systems of this type were
used successfully on press circuits and on telegraph message station-to-station
circuitry, trouble was experienced when a number of printer send-receive
units were set up in an intercommunicating system. Here it was
found that the receiver start was not always in time with the transmitter
start, due to varying line circuit conditions and a variation in the start
release mechanism at connected stations.</p>
<p>It seems odd that synchronous systems, where both transmitter and
receiver were started at the same time (requiring both transmitter and
receiver to maintain synchronism), held the field for so long a time, thus
limiting telegraph transmission to one-way operation.</p>
<p>It evidently took a mind not bound or hampered by the standard and
accepted way of operating synchronous systems to discard such old
ideas and to set forth boldly on a new pattern which, in reality, differed
but slightly from the then-established synchronous systems, and to sow
the seed for starting further developments leading to the present telegraph
typewriter, TWX, and TELEX intercommunicating systems. Such
a man was Howard L. Krum, who, in further thinking on the subject,
came upon the almost simple idea of having the transmitter start the
receiver rather than having them both start at the same time. This
arrangement required higher speed operation of the receiver and therefore
the receiving code pulse positions were spread over a shorter area,
which meant progressively decreasing the angular division of the
receiving members. Then, to set the received start pulse in the most
favorable position with relation to the following code signal reception,
an orientation adjustment of the receiver start position was provided.</p>
<p>(Note: On June 20, 1961, Kleinschmidt wrote to Howard Krum&mdash;then
in retirement in California&mdash;giving a short description of the
Morkrum Company activities, including the wording of the above last
two paragraphs, and asking him to write the Morkrum story. Howard
Krum replied on July 3, 1961, indicating his approval and saying that
he would be glad to put together some notes for Kleinschmidt. It was
quite a shock, therefore, when a letter was received from Howard
Krum&rsquo;s son, Charles, in September of 1961, telling of his father&rsquo;s sudden
serious illness. Then, regretfully, it was not long afterwards that
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
word was received of Howard Krum&rsquo;s death on November 13, 1961.)</p>

<p>Howard Krum&rsquo;s improved method for operating start-stop, permutation-code
telegraph systems was first applied to the Morkrum Green Code
apparatus to control the selecting and printing operations of the Blickensdoerfer
typewheel typewriter.</p>
<p>At this time the Kleinschmidt company and other manufacturers were
starting to produce permutation-code, start-stop telegraph printers using
typebar printing like the more modern typewriters which began rapidly
to replace the Blickensdoerfer, the Hammond, and the other typewheel
printing typewriters. Observing this situation, the Morkrum Company
started intensive development work to produce the No. 12 typebar page
printer, using the typebars and operating mechanism of the L. C. Smith
typewriter and platen of a Woodstock typewriter (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>).</p>
<p>Further developments produced the Morkrum No. 11 tape printer
which used the Baudot combiner method for selecting and printing
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
characters under control of start-stop, send-receive devices. The No. 11
was a small, compact tape printer operating at fifty words per minute.
Quite a number were put into service at hotels and elsewhere for local
message service (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>The new No. 12 typebar page printer found numerous applications.
It replaced the Green Code and the earlier Blue Code wherever used.
The new No. 12 was installed at Western Union, on some railroads, and
in the Chicago Police telegraph system. The No. 12s were also installed
by Postal Telegraph on intercity circuits and used as receiving units
for the Postal Multiplex. The Postal Multiplex had been designed by
Morkrum and Postal engineers with the consultant assistance of Donald
Murray who was a friendly associate and had a license agreement with
the Morkrum Company covering some of his patents. A few No. 12
Morkrums were shipped abroad for use with the Murray Multiplex; the
British Post Office Telegraph and the Australian Telegraph Administration
were customers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Late in 1924 the Morkrum Company and the Kleinschmidt Electric
Company joined to form the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation. A story
telling of the union of these two companies was published by <i>Fortune</i>
magazine in March of 1932.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Before going to that story, it may be of interest to describe an important
event concerning the change in the supply of electric power from direct
current to 60-cycle alternating current and the final timing to exactly 60
cycles per second of all A.C. power supplies so that our electric clocks may
be connected to an A.C. outlet and give correct time.</p>
<p>The advent of correctly timed, 60-cycle A.C. electric power, available
throughout the nation, was a great boon to the designers of printing telegraph
apparatus and some types of facsimile telegraph and picture transmitting
systems. In prior years, overline synchronization of send and
receive apparatus was always a problem and never perfect. Today, synchronizing
apparatus between terminals becomes the simple matter of
providing 60-cycle A.C. synchronous motors. Just plug into a power outlet
and you have &ldquo;sync&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Henry Ellis Warren, a clock maker, noting the change in electric power
service from direct current to 60-cycle alternating current, set about to
build a motor to operate at 60-cycle speed but found that the 60-cycle
frequency did not always hold to form, and when applied to running a
clock, did not hold correct time.</p>
<p>The following excerpt, from <i>The Romance of Time</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> tells of
Warren&rsquo;s activities which led to synchronizing 60-cycle alternating
current to exact time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="center"><i>Synchronous Electric Time</i></span></p>
<p>One of the most important of all contributions to horology is the work
of an American who has earned the title, &ldquo;Father of Electric Time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Ellis Warren was graduated from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1894. In 1907 he married and settled in Ashland, Massachusetts.
Here it was that he began to work out his idea for electrically
operated timepieces.</p>
<p>His first product was an ingenious battery-operated clock. In 1914 he
organized the Warren Clock Company and set up production in a barn
on his farm. Yet he knew the battery clock was not his goal, for direct
current offered no means of accurate regulation. Direct current flows constantly
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
in one direction only, like water down a river or like the passage
of time. On the other hand, alternating current changes direction regularly,
like the oscillation of the balance wheel in a watch. But instead of the
usual five times a second of the balance wheel, most alternating current
completes its trip forward and backward sixty times a second. Obviously,
a clock &ldquo;geared&rdquo; to such a frequency would run as reliably as the current.</p>
<p>In 1916, after several years of extensive experimentation, Warren developed
a motor which would start by itself, run on alternating current,
and carry without difficulty the load of reduction gears driving the clock
hands. It could also handle the cams and contacts of an alarm clock or
set in motion a striking or chiming mechanism.</p>
<p>Then came the test. He plugged the clock into the power socket. It
commenced to run. Weeks of observation and checking showed an irregular
error of as much as ten to fifteen minutes a day.</p>
<p>Convinced that his clock was right, Warren discovered that the alternating
current frequency delivered to his barn factory was off half a cycle
per second&mdash;59&frac12; and not 60 cycles. This slight deflection would produce
that much time loss in a 24-hour run. When he informed the electric
company of this error, he was met at first with polite disbelief. Yet he
showed such a comprehensive knowledge of the subject that the company
began to recheck their standards.</p>
<p>Warren built several more synchronous clocks and a master regulator
of his own design for power-station use. On one dial of his master clock
there were two hands, black and gold. The black hand was connected to
an accurately adjusted pendulum clock, beating seconds. The gold hand
was driven by the gear train of one of his electric clocks. As long as
the two hands revolved together, the current cycles were exactly 60
per second. Set up in a power station, this allowed the operator to adjust
the turbine generators as needed to keep the two hands of the master
clock together. Thus all other properly set electric clocks on the same
system would keep the same time automatically.</p>
<p>The Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston tried out the
master clock on October 23, 1916. Since then this regulation has continued.</p>
<p>Other power companies adopted Warren&rsquo;s master clock. Today virtually
all alternating current furnished in America is similarly checked. Practical
electric time is available at the light socket almost everywhere. But there
are additional benefits.</p>
<p>Standardizing the frequency expanded the market for current to run
the increasing number of clocks in use. Yet, from the consumer&rsquo;s point
of view, each clock draws little current, costing but a few pennies a month.
Uniform frequency also gave more even speeds in motor-driven machinery,
with a resultant improvement in product. It made easier the joining of
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
one power station to another. Synchronous motors used in certain meters
and recorders produced better, more accurate records at lower cost.</p>
<p>The Warren enterprise expanded rapidly. The battery clock was discontinued.
The red barn was no longer large enough, and new space was
acquired. The trade mark &ldquo;Telechron,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;time from a distance&rdquo;
(from two Greek words), was used to identify all products of the company.
The firm name was changed to stress the name Telechron, and in 1952 a
merger was made with the General Electric Company. Plants are now
operated in Worcester as well as in Ashland, Massachusetts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now back to the telegraph field....</p>

<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER 4
<br />Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation
<br /><span class="small">(later renamed &ldquo;Teletype Corporation&rdquo;)</span></h2>
<p>During and after the first world war, both the Morkrum Company and
the Kleinschmidt Electric Company were progressively developing and
producing telegraph apparatus and bringing out new and improved operating
devices to a point where conflicting patents were at issue. This meant
infringement litigation which might destroy both companies. Neither
company could obtain orders in sufficient quantity to make the manufacturing
of apparatus profitable, and, with costly development work at hand,
more capital investment was a continuous requirement.</p>
<p>The following excerpts from the March 1932 issue of <i>Fortune</i><a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> tells of
the final joining of the two companies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Morkrum Co. had no profits to show for its efforts, and one can be
fairly safe in assuming that no other maker of telegraph printers made
profits. There were competitors, of course. Even the first telegraph invented
by Samuel Morse had a printer, but it printed in dots and dashes instead
of in letters of the English alphabet. That original Morse printer was
abandoned as far back as 1844 because a man who could be trained to read
dots and dashes could just as easily be trained to listen to them. The problem
of getting a printer to print the alphabet was faced by inventors more
than half a century ago, and it was not really a difficult problem. The difficulty
was to invent a printer that was not too complicated and delicate to be
reliable, that was simple enough to be manufactured for a few hundred
instead of a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>This difficulty occupied many minds other than the Morton-Krum intelligences.
The most noteworthy of Morkrum Co.&rsquo;s rivals in printer-making
was Edward Kleinschmidt, an inventor who had all the inventor&rsquo;s legendary
devotion to his task and to nothing else. His creations included a vaccination
shield, an automatic fishing reel, and the perfection of the Wheatstone
perforator. He had been tinkering with a telegraph printer in one form and
another since the beginning of the century. In 1917 his project was revamped.
It had the financial backing of Charles B. Goodspeed, of the Buckeye
Steel Casting Co.; Paul M. Benedict, assistant to the president of the
C. B. &amp; Q.; Edward Moore, son of Judge Moore of American Can fame;
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Eldon Bisbee, a New York lawyer; and one of Mr. Bisbee&rsquo;s legal clients,
Albert Henry Wiggin, then president of the Chase National Bank. It was
Mr. Goodspeed, a quiet, retiring gentleman, who supplied most of the corporate
(as distinct from inventive) energy of the Kleinschmidt Electric Co....</p>
<p>In the years from 1917 to 1924 the Kleinschmidt and the Morkrum
companies became the leading makers of telegraph printers, but they did
not have an easy row to hoe. Their only possible customers were the two
great telegraph companies, the Telephone company, the railroads, and an
occasional outside business such as a press association. The competition was
disheartening, and it became keener with the elevation of Sterling, son of
Joy Morton, to the presidency of the Morkrum Co., an elevation that was
mainly a War-time accident, for Sterling Morton had resigned from his
father&rsquo;s company to enlist in the Army, had been rejected because of a
small steel plate in his anatomy, and had chosen the Morkrum Co. as an
alternative. Engineering progress was made, sometimes under ludicrous
circumstances.</p>
<p>There was one occasion when Sterling Morton, about to sail for Europe,
heard that the Kleinschmidt Co. was about to bring out a simplex printer.
Up to that time both companies had been making printers for use with
multiplex machines. Mr. Morton was afraid that Mr. Kleinschmidt was
about to anticipate him in the simplex development which was the forerunner
of the present teletypewriter. This was a contingency which Mr.
Morton could not well permit. On the spur of the moment, he called on
Howard Krum, who happened to be in New York. They bought a drawing
board, hired a room at the Princeton Club, and worked for twenty-four
hours trying to design such a machine. Completely baffled by one small
detail, they gave up and took a bus for Coney Island. On the way, Howard
Krum doubled up in sudden ecstacy and inspiration. They rushed from the
bus at Coney Island, entered a soda fountain, and on the spot designed the
machine on the back of an envelope. This simplex machine of the Morkrum
Co. and the one developed by Kleinschmidt at the same time are the machines
which make Teletype commercially important, the substance of the
business today.</p>
<p>But engineering progress was not business progress. Both companies from
the standpoint of profits were failures. Their few customers played them off
against each other. In despair, they were both willing to sell out. At one
point Mr. Goodspeed offered the Kleinschmidt company to Mr. Newcomb
Carlton of Western Union for $412,000, the amount invested in it. Mr.
Morton sold his company in all but fact to Mr. Charles G. du Bois, then
president of Western Electric, but Mr. du Bois went off to Europe, and his
substitute refused to see any merit in the deal. So it fell through. Unable
to sell themselves to their customers, they tried selling themselves to each
other. In 1923 Messrs. Goodspeed and Morton came to terms. The Morkrum
Co. signed the agreement and, everything arranged, Mr. Goodspeed
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
went off to bicycle with his wife in South Africa&mdash;whereupon his company
suddenly changed its mind.</p>
<p>That was the situation of these two unfortunate companies in 1924 when
Mr. Morton started a suit for patent infringement against his rivals. A
counter suit was promptly filed. Mr. Goodspeed was quite right when he
said the suits would ruin both&mdash;there was every prospect that by the time
the courts had settled things, the patents would have been in such a snarl
that neither could do anything. The suit, in fact, was Sterling Morton&rsquo;s
way of bringing matters to a head. So, figuratively speaking, on the courthouse
steps they merged.</p>
<p>The terms of the merger as embodied in the six-line agreement (it was
later made over into a twenty-five-page legal document which concluded
by saying that in case of dispute the six-line agreement should be the final
authority) were these: each of the old companies received a half interest
in the common stock (10,000 shares) of the new company; 15,000 shares
(callable at 105) of the new company&rsquo;s preferred stock should be divided
according to the assets of the old companies. Actually, 13,979 shares of
preferred were issued, the majority going to the Morkrum group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so it was that the agreement to join both companies under the
name Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation was consummated and chartered
in the State of Delaware on December 29, 1924, with Sterling
Morton as President, Howard L. Krum as Vice President in charge of
manufacturing, and Edward E. Kleinschmidt as Vice President in charge
of development, patents and foreign sales.</p>
<p>One of the first decisions to make was whether the Kleinschmidt plant
in Long Island City or the Morkrum plant in Chicago would be the headquarters
for the new company. The Kleinschmidt company was on a
27,000-foot leased floor in a building which R. H. Macy Company had
just purchased to use for a warehouse, and negotiations had been going
on for some time for the purchase of the Kleinschmidt lease&mdash;the sum of
$25,000.00 having been offered. When the union of the two companies
was decided upon, an agreement to vacate on the terms offered was
signed, and the Kleinschmidt firm moved to the Morkrum-owned plant
in Chicago.</p>

</div>
<p>Bringing together the engineering talent and patents of the two companies
had an immediate effect toward further progress. The first thing
the new company set out to do, through consolidation of their past efforts,
was to perfect a satisfactory start-stop-operated tape printer for the Western
Union Telegraph Company to use for circuit extension to customers
who were extensively using the telegraph for immediate, written communication.
(This was to speed up telegraphic communication and eliminate
the need for messenger service which had been the custom.) The
Morkrum company had submitted their start-stop-operated Baudot tape
printer, and the Kleinschmidt company had proposed the Western Union
No. 22 tape printer in a redesign to start-stop operation. Now, the new
company was able to combine both plans and as a result came up with
their first development, a typebar, start-stop-operated, tape printer, the No.
14 (see <a href="#fig10">figure 10</a>). In the final design, Howard Krum and his production
engineers took a large part. After tests and evaluation, Western Union&rsquo;s
first order was for 10,000 machines at $317.00 each. This amounted to a
total of $3,170,000.00. No such quantity had ever been heard of before!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>It is quite evident that while the two companies were separated, each
coming up with improved and new designs of telegraph apparatus, there
was a lack of decision by telegraph companies as to which type of apparatus
to adopt in expanding their operations, and therefore they did
not buy in quantity. The largest previous order to the Kleinschmidt Electric
Company was for 800 No. 22 typebar tape printers for the Western
Union Multiplex.</p>
<p>At Morkrum-Kleinschmidt more space was needed. The corner property
on Wrightwood Avenue adjoining the Morkrum plant was purchased,
and a four-story building was erected.</p>
<p>The design of a telegraph typewriter that would be more efficient and
require a minimum of maintenance service was the most important project,
and Morkrum-Kleinschmidt was working with Bell Laboratories engineers
endeavoring to meet all the requirements of the Bell Telephone
system. A typebar printer with a stationary printing platen and moving
typebar printing unit was specified. These requirements were finally met
with the design of the No. 15 page printer to operate at 60 words per
minute, and manufacture of this apparatus was started in 1927 (see <a href="#fig11">figure 11</a>).
The No. 15 page printer became the standard for nationwide intercommunicating
telegraph service for many years.</p>
<p>In 1926, soon after the No. 14 tape printer was put into service,
Morkrum-Kleinschmidt received a request from the police department of
Berlin, Germany, for detailed information, stating that they were interested
in the purchase of about sixty No. 14 printers. The letter asked if
Morkrum-Kleinschmidt was represented by an agent in Germany whom
they could contact. At an executive meeting, Mr. Morton and Mr. Krum
asked Mr. Kleinschmidt to take care of this matter since his company,
before joining them, had sold apparatus in some foreign countries. After
further correspondence with the Berlin police officials, Kleinschmidt decided
personally to take a No. 14 printer to Germany and arrange for a
representative there. After visiting and conferring with several companies
experienced in the telegraph and associated apparatus field, a satisfactory
arrangement was consummated with the C. Lorenz Company, on October
25, 1926, for the manufacture and sale of Morkrum-Kleinschmidt
equipment in Germany, on a royalty-licensing basis. At that time the
Lorenz company manufactured telegraph and telephone equipment and
railway signaling apparatus. Their engineering department was under the
supervision of Dr. Gerhard Grimsen who took the matter in hand for
further exploitation toward an intercommunicating printing telegraph
system, using the No. 15 page teletypewriter. Siemens &amp; Halske, the
principal manufacturers of telegraph equipment in Germany, were also
licensed by the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation, on June 1, 1929,
with the consent of the Lorenz company.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>(As may be seen in the <a href="#c6">following chapter</a>, it was these licensing arrangements
which led to the establishment of the TELEX intercommunicating
teleprinter system in Europe.)</p>
<p>In early 1927 the well-known newspaper publisher, Mr. Frank E. Gannett,
came to Morkrum-Kleinschmidt, bringing his company&rsquo;s engineer,
Mr. Walter Morey, who had heard of various attempts to operate a typesetting
machine, such as Linotype or Intertype, directly from the telegraph.
Mr. Gannett said, &ldquo;We have telegraph typewriters in our news
rooms that record the news as transmitted from the Associated Press and
the United Press, and that is fine. Now, why not go a step further and
operate our typesetting machines directly from the telegraph circuit? If
you can develop such a device, I will help finance the project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, after some study of the matter, the possibility of devising such a
system seemed entirely feasible and the development of suitable apparatus
was turned over to the research and development department. A workable
plan was soon put together and a separate company, the Teletypesetter
Company, was organized, with Mr. Gannett joining financially.
Edward Kleinschmidt was elected president. Development proceeded and
a complete set of apparatus was set up and publicly demonstrated for the
first time on December 6, 1928, at one of Mr. Gannett&rsquo;s newspapers,
<i>The Times Union</i> of Rochester, New York. Teletypesetter equipment
was subsequently manufactured for several installations. After the Western
Electric Company purchased the Teletype Corporation in 1930, the
Teletypesetter Company was sold to the Fairchild Company. Teletypesetter
equipment is now in universal use by most newspapers and the
larger printing companies.</p>
<p>During the period that the United States&rsquo; business cycle was on a
continuous upswing (during the late 1920s), securities sales on the New
York Stock Exchange were going to constantly higher volume, and the
old step-by-step stock ticker did not, by large margins, keep pace in recording
stock share transactions. There was a cry for a higher speed stock
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
ticker; in fact, the Stock Exchange officials told Morkrum-Kleinschmidt
that they would be happy to convert the entire system if they could get
higher speed.</p>
<p>An adaptation of the five-unit-code, start-stop system seemed the solution
and the Research and Development department set out to develop
suitable apparatus. Several ideas were studied and, because of the frequent
changes from letters to figures, requiring printing in separate rows
on the tape, a six-unit code was adapted instead in which combinations for
a figure included the sixth selecting pulse to operate the figures print
hammer and block the letters print hammer.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 12
<span class="btc">Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation Stock Ticker</span><span class="btr small"><i>Picture through courtesy of Teletype Corporation</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>The Morkrum-Kleinschmidt company was soon able to show the Stock
Exchange people a stock ticker operating on a telegraph system that
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
worked at twice the speed of the step-by-step-operated tickers then in use.
A speed of 500 printing operations per minute could be obtained, thus
attaining a one-hundred-percent increase in the transmitting and recording
of stock quotations on the tape (see <a href="#fig12">figure 12</a>). The Stock Exchange
ticker service company ordered 15,000 of these high-speed tickers and the
Western Union Telegraph Company also ordered a quantity for their
national stock quotations distributing systems.</p>
<p>As business of the combined Morkrum and Kleinschmidt companies
went along, it was thought that the name &ldquo;Morkrum-Kleinschmidt
Corporation&rdquo; was a pretty big mouthful and that a simpler name more
characteristic of its products would be better. The name &ldquo;Teletype&rdquo; was
suggested, and in the year 1928 the name change to &ldquo;Teletype Corporation&rdquo;
was made. The exact origin of the word &ldquo;teletype&rdquo; is not known but
it is no doubt one of the abbreviated forms of the words &ldquo;telegraph typewriter&rdquo;
which were used over the years. In literature, in the early 1900s,
we find that the word &ldquo;teletype,&rdquo; in speaking of printing telegraph equipment,
and other shortened forms, such as &ldquo;telewriter&rdquo; and &ldquo;teletyper,&rdquo;
were used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s son, Edward F., who studied electrical engineering at
Steven&rsquo;s Institute and at Northwestern University, was employed as development
engineer by the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt company where he
assisted in the design of projects at hand, and, during 1929, produced a
system and apparatus for transmitting and recording printed characters by
the successive transmission of dots arranged in a pattern to form letters.
While this system required a higher signaling frequency, it was thought
to be superior to permutation-code transmission over radio circuits where
electrostatic interference is experienced, since, in the dot pattern transmission,
electrostatic interference up to a degree will not change the readability
of a transmitted letter.</p>
<p>The system was in test operation to prove its efficiency over radio circuits
where considerable static interference was experienced. Upon hearing
of this new telegraph for the radio, Mr. R. Stanley Dollar became
interested in the use of this communicating system for his steamship
line. There was considerable correspondence in this matter during mid-1930,
just prior to the sale of Teletype; however, neither AT&amp;T nor
Western Electric was interested in further promoting this new radio
telegraph, so the matter was dropped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Business activities of Teletype Corporation were now growing rapidly
and with good profit. The capital structure of 10,000 shares was wholly
inadequate, so by a 15-to-1 stock dividend the capital structure was raised
to 150,000 shares, and dividends on an annual basis of $12.00 were paid.</p>
<p>The successful development of apparatus for different applications
useful in the telegraph field was largely due to the close cooperation
between the research-development and the manufacturing departments
of the organization. Howard Krum had expert engineers and designers
in his department, Kleinschmidt brought his leading engineers and
designers from the Long Island City plant, and there was a definite
spirit of cooperation all around.</p>
<p>To quote again from the <i>Fortune</i> magazine story:<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the years up to 1925, when the Kleinschmidt-Morkrum merger took
place, were wanderings in a profitless desert, so the years from 1925 to
1930 found the teletype in a land of milk and honey. Mr. Morton, however,
was inclined to think that a company which had only two or three
major customers is not strongly placed. Furthermore (and by the spring of
1930), at least one of those customers was actively in the market as a
Teletype purchaser. This buyer was Colonel Sosthenes Behn, whose International
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. includes Postal Telegraph at home in
addition to many communication and manufacturing companies abroad.
With Colonel Behn wanting to buy and Mr. Morton wanting to sell, negotiations
rapidly proceeded to a point at which Mr. Morton, at least, thought
the deal was almost concluded. But while Mr. Morton and the Colonel
were discussing the prospective acquisition, into the Colonel&rsquo;s office walked
a man who has no other place in this story except that he happened to
interrupt at this moment. As this gentleman was introduced, he asked
whether Mr. Morton were related to Joy or Paul Morton. When Mr.
Morton admitted that they were his father and uncle, the man turned to
Colonel Behn and said in jest: &ldquo;Better watch your step. That&rsquo;s a smart
family.&rdquo; Only Colonel Behn knows whether he gave that remark any
weight, but the point is that the negotiations suddenly collapsed, and that
the visitor&rsquo;s remark about the smart family still lives vividly in Mr. Morton&rsquo;s
memory.</p>
<p>This setback was not a setback at all to such a negotiator as Mr. Morton.
Two months later, in May, 1930, you find him walking into the office of
Clarence G. Stoll, vice president of Western Electric, A. T. &amp; T.&rsquo;s manufacturing
subsidiary. This time there had been no preliminaries. Mr. Stoll
rose from his desk and said: &ldquo;Good morning. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to buy Teletype?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it for sale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at a price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Let&rsquo;s get down to business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They got down to business on the spot, and they remained at it for three
solid days in Mr. Stoll&rsquo;s office. The agreement as reached called for
A. T. &amp; T. to pay off the preferred stock of Teletype, 13,979 shares callable
at 105, and to give one share of A. T. &amp; T. in exchange for each common
share of Teletype. The A. T. &amp; T. shares were worth about $200, so the
price came to upwards of $30,000,000&mdash;plus, of course, the $1,467,795 for
retiring the Teletype preferred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted here that this deal to take over Teletype on a
share-for-share basis was exclusive of foreign patent rights but did include
patent rights in Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>The sale to Western Electric was closed on September 30, 1930. Mr.
Stoll of that company was made president. Howard Krum continued
on as vice president and was a leader in developing a number of commendable
devices, including a system for transmitting messages in
scrambled, untranslatable code form and receiving such scrambled code
in perfect message form. Mr. Morton was retained as consultant. Edward
Kleinschmidt made an arrangement to do development work for the new
organization in a laboratory of his own, assigning all inventions to the
Teletype Corporation (see <a href="#Page_50">page 50</a>).</p>
<p>After Kleinschmidt left Teletype, his assistant, Albert H. Reiber,
carried on as head of Research and Development for a short while before
his untimely death. In the meantime, Walter J. Zenner had advanced
and, in 1935, became Department Chief and later Vice President in
Charge of Research and Development. Under Zenner&rsquo;s direction a number
of new devices in the teleprinter field were developed, including
ultra-high-speed tape-perforating and tape-controlled transmitting devices,
as well as a high-speed stock ticker operating at 900 characters per minute
(introduced in 1964) to replace the earlier Morkrum-Kleinschmidt ticker
which operated at 500 characters per minute. Some 94 patents were
issued in his name, which have contributed greatly to the growth of
the Teletype Corporation.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>On May 15, 1940, Howard Krum and Edward E. Kleinschmidt were
both honored by The Franklin Institute and awarded the John Price
Wetherill Medal, each one &ldquo;For his Part in the Development of a
Successful Electrically Operated Duplicate Typewriting Machine Now
Known as the Teletypewriter,&rdquo; (Quoted from the medal certificate.)</p>

<p>Howard Krum later also received an award as Modern Pioneer from
the National Manufacturers Association. Edward E. Kleinschmidt, on
April 19, 1958, was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering
at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.</p>
<p>To continue: After the sale of patent rights in Canada, Mexico, and
the United States to Western Electric, there remained the European and
other foreign patent rights still with the original Morkrum and Kleinschmidt
investors. The International Telephone and Telegraph Company
wanted these rights, and, after negotiations in New York, a price was
set for their purchase through the Creed Company in London, then
owned by IT&amp;T. Edward Kleinschmidt was sent to London in 1930
to close the deal. Some changes to the sales contract were requested by
Creed which kept the cables busy by Kleinschmidt in asking for approval
from A. T. &amp; T. and Western Electric lawyers. Finally, upon all-around
approval, the contract was signed at the previously-agreed-to price of one
and a quarter million dollars.</p>

<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER 5
<br />Teletypewriter Intercommunication Expands</h2>
<h3 id="c6"><i>TELEX</i></h3>
<p>As a result of the acquisition of patents of the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt
Company by the Lorenz company, Siemens &amp; Halske, and, later, the
Creed company in England, all of which we have discussed briefly,
teletypewriter intercommunicating expanded rapidly. In just a short time,
through the cooperation of these companies, it spread over all of Europe
and was named TELEX (<i>TEL</i>eprinter <i>EX</i>change Service).</p>
<p>Dr. Gerhard Grimsen of the Lorenz company, in a letter to Edward E.
Kleinschmidt, dated July 11, 1962, states, in part (slightly edited):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story of printing telegraph apparatus using an equal length code in
the Lorenz Co. commences in 1927 with the acquisition of the most important
patents of the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Co.</p>
<p>Before then, the Lorenz people were busy in manufacturing Morse
apparatus and delivering exchange tickers which used the Hughes code.
The transmitter had a piano keyboard, the receiver was a page printer with
a moving type wheel.... The biggest network of this kind was installed in
the Berlin Police service (with one transmitter and about 300 receivers).
The connections between the headquarters and the substations were built
by using guttapercha cable lines owned by the police administration. This
broadcasting network was erected around 1907. By 1927 the cables had
aged, by normal corrosion, to such a degree that instead of 110-volt double
current transmitting voltage, little by little, up to 220 volts was necessary
for a fairly satisfying operation. Also, the maintenance of the apparatus
became more costly.</p>
<p>This was the situation when some communication experts of the police
and the post administration made the first studies about the newest telegraph
technique in the U. S. A.... They found that the start-stop, five-unit
tape printer, the Model 14, developed and manufactured by the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt
company, would be the best instrument to replace the old
ones in the police service as well as in the telegraph business of the German
post administration.</p>
<p>Of special importance to the police service was the fact that by introducing
this apparatus, it was not necessary to build a new network because now
it became possible to rent normal telephone lines using single current,
40-milliampere, 60-volt current only.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Siemens and Halske engineers, in 1925, had designed a teleprinter
using the five-unit-code, start-stop principle. This was manufactured and
improvements added, including the new start-stop method developed by
Morkrum-Kleinschmidt. The Creed company, which had started manufacture
of start-stop teleprinters before 1930, having purchased several
Morkrum printers before the consolidation of that company with the
Kleinschmidt company, also designed a teleprinter for the new five-unit-code,
start-stop system.</p>
<p>In another write-up, Dr. Grimsen states that after the Siemens company
came into the picture, a fully automatic teleprinter network was
started in 1933 with a trial installation between Berlin and Hamburg
for about forty private subscribers. The results were so encouraging that
the German Reichspost continued the work, and five years later the
TELEX system contained about 10,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>TELEX service was introduced in Great Britain in 1932 and was
worked over the telephone network, using a single-tone voice frequency
carrier signal which was keyed on and off by the teleprinter transmitter.
(From Freebody&rsquo;s <i>Telegraphy</i>.)<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Interconnection for TELEX service was made by dialing a subscriber
as in telephone operation. TELEX directories then, as now, gave the call
numbers of subscribers. Types of answerback devices were designed in
both England and Germany which finally developed into an arrangement
whereby the calling subscriber would, after dialing a number, press a
special key, the shifted D key&mdash;named the &ldquo;Who-Are-You?&rdquo; button&mdash;which
would cause the transmission of a signal code automatically to
activate the called teletypewriter mechanism into transmitting its TELEX
number.</p>
<p>Further apparatus, a device to punch the code in a tape and a punched-tape-controlled
transmitter, was soon added.</p>
<p>The Siemens company also developed and built completely automatic
switching equipment for the TELEX system which is used by many
telegraph administrations.</p>
<p>Through the cooperation of the companies who were manufacturing
teleprinters and associated equipment, the many problems that appeared
were eventually solved to improve the apparatus and bring the TELEX

system to eventual perfection for worldwide telegraph communications.
(At the time of this writing, according to statistics, there are nearly
1,000,000 TELEX subscribers throughout the world.)</p>
<p>One of the problems faced in setting up such a worldwide system was
that of standardizing the code and operating speed. At the time of Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s
stay in London in 1930 to close negotiations with Creed for the
sale of Morkrum-Kleinschmidt&rsquo;s foreign rights, he met Mr. Martin Feuerhahn
of the German Telegraph Administration who at that time was in
conference with Creed and representatives from the British Telegraph
Administration as to standardizing on an alphabet and telegraph code
for international communications. Mr. Feuerhahn argued for the adoption
of the American Murray alphabet and code, stating that he already
had the approval and consent of the French, Italian, and Belgian telegraph
administrations.</p>
<p>Mr. Feuerhahn and Kleinschmidt spent some hours together. After
their return to their respective countries, Kleinschmidt received a letter
from Mr. Feuerhahn referring to their talks and stating that he had been
in correspondence with Mr. Benjamin of Western Union and Mr. Parker
of Bell Laboratories with regard to code and other pertinent matters of
standardization so that an International Teleprinter Exchange could be
extended into the United States. Another letter dated October 10, 1931,
reviewed the aforementioned standardization search.</p>
<p>The Murray alphabet and 7&frac12;-unit code were soon adopted and are
still in use today in TELEX.</p>
<p>In later years, an association, the Consultative Committee on International
Telegraph (CCIT&mdash;now the CCITT to include the telephone),
was formed and met regularly to discuss problems and to set operating
regulations for the TELEX apparatus in an intercommunicating system.
The CCITT at this writing is still meeting regularly on worldwide standardization
in both telegraph and telephone communications.</p>
<h3 id="c7"><i>TELEX IN THE UNITED STATES AND TWX</i></h3>
<p>In the United States, in November 1931, the Bell Telephone Companies
announced an intercommunicating teletypewriter service, called
TWX for short (<i>T</i>eletype<i>W</i>riter e<i>X</i>change), by which interconnections
could be made by a switchboard operator as in telephone service. One of
their first advertisements named it a &ldquo;Telephone Typewriter Service, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
service that typewrites by wire, a method of inter-office communication
that has the quickness of the telephone, the flexibility of conversation, the
accuracy of the typewriter, the authority of the printed word, the permanency
of print.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> Tape-punching and tape-controlled transmitting apparatus
was provided. This service allowed subscribers to carry on a
typewritten conversation at a charge less than the cost of a telephone call,
whether to local or to distant areas. The maximum speed of this equipment
was limited to sixty words per minute.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill15">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>There are approximately 54,000 subscribers to TWX at this writing,
and the TWX directory gets fatter with each new issue. In 1962 all TWX
machines were converted to direct dialing operation, making the service
easier to use. Instead of going through &ldquo;Operator&rdquo; by manually typing
out the call letters of the party being called, one now merely depresses
the Originate button, listens for the dial tone, and then dials the TWX
number of the party wanted.</p>
<p>RCA Communications, Inc., was the first to extend international
TELEX service to Bell System teletypewriter subscribers (1955), enabling
them to make and receive overseas calls on their domestic TWX
machines.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> As stated, the TWX machines were geared for 60-words-per-minute
operation, whereas the TELEX system operated at 66 words per
minute. It was therefore necessary for R.C.A. to use conversion apparatus
to an error-detecting code for overseas radio transmission. This code was a
seven-unit code, using three marking and four spacing elements, giving
35 usable combinations. By using a special printer, when a faulty combination
was received, a special error symbol was printed.</p>
<p>Western Union, in May of 1958, introduced TELEX service between
New York City and various Canadian points. By 1962 the service had
been extended to 67 United States cities, and at this writing they expect
to serve 180 United States cities with an anticipated subscriber capacity
of many thousands.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>In addition to domestic service between U. S. cities, subscribers can
dial automatic teleprinter connections to Canada and Mexico. Also, they
can obtain direct TELEX connections to other parts of the world through
the overseas facilities of RCAC (Radio Corporation of America Communications),
AC&amp;R (American Cable and Radio), and WUI (Western
Union International). The operating speed of 66 words per minute and
also the teleprinter keyboard in the U. S. TELEX network conform to
international standards of the CCITT. This provides complete operating
compatibility with other TELEX systems throughout the world without
the need for speed and keyboard translators.<a class="fn" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>

<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER 6
<br />KLEINSCHMIDT LABORATORIES</h2>
<p>As we have seen, Edward Kleinschmidt, upon resigning from Teletype
Corporation as vice president when it was taken over by Western Electric,
had agreed to do development work for them, working independently
but assigning any inventions to the new Teletype Corporation.</p>
<p>And so it was that Kleinschmidt Laboratories came into existence.
Incorporated on March 21, 1931, under Delaware laws, for the immediate
purpose of doing research and development work for Teletype, the
principals of the new company were Edward E. as president, and his
two sons, Edward F. as vice president and Bernard L. as secretary.</p>
<p>Kleinschmidt had earlier proposed a comprehensive and completely
automatic printing telegraph switching system in which messages are
automatically routed from the subscriber printer through telegraph centrals
of the addressee printer under control of address tape perforations.
Under his development contract with Teletype he continued work on
the system. Message storage in perforated tape was provided for at all
central switching points, and an answerback arrangement was included
in the system by the automatic return transmission of the addressee&rsquo;s
number to the sender.</p>
<p>As the research and development work for Teletype continued, the
switching system was completed, and various other devices of more or
less importance were developed, with patents assigned to the Teletype
Corporation. In late 1934 the contract with Teletype expired.</p>
<p>At that time, son Bernard was operating a printing plant in rather close
quarters in Highland Park, Illinois. The operations of the Laboratories
had been carried on in rented quarters at the Merchandise Mart in
Chicago. Seeing that there would be no work for Teletype, it was decided
to set up working quarters in Highland Park where the family lived.
Since rented space was not available, a building was constructed on
Lincolnwood Road in the Braeside section of Highland Park to house
both the B. L. Kleinschmidt Printing Company and the machinery and
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
other equipment of the Laboratories. The Laboratories, now inactive,
became a personal holding company with 2300 shares to cover a book
value of approximately $230,000.00 (Kleinschmidt having distributed
the major portion of these shares to his children and grandchildren).</p>
<p>Son Edward F. turned his thoughts to other fields and carried on experimental
work in the new building in devices not connected with the
telegraph. Son Bernard was involved in his printing business. Their
father&rsquo;s thoughts lay dormant for a long time, but still there was the urge
to continue with the telegraph, and a plan for operating a five-unit-code
selecting mechanism, operating on a progressive stop principle to position
a typewheel or to select a typebar for printing on tape or page, was worked
out.</p>
<p>When models of this new plan were completed and operating successfully,
Edward E. Kleinschmidt immediately thought of Teletype Corporation
and brought the apparatus to their attention, submitting models
and patent applications for their evaluation. After numerous conferences
and correspondence, however, his offer for the sale of patent rights and
models was rejected. Discouraged, he left the completed models at the
Highland Park lab and moved to Florida.</p>
<p>During the second world war, son Bernard abandoned his printing
establishment and started a tool and die shop, using the machinery and
facilities of the Laboratories as well as space occupied by his printing
shop. The B. L. Kleinschmidt Company was kept busy building tools,
dies, and special devices for the war effort.</p>
<p>Through Bernard&rsquo;s associations he learned that the United States
Signal Corps needed a light-weight, transportable teleprinter for tactical
field use, and he asked his father if he could show the progressive stop
printer to the Signal Corps at their Chicago headquarters. His father, in
Miami at that time, gave his approval. Two days later, the telephone rang
in Miami and it was Bernard saying, &ldquo;Dad, they are interested and want
you to bring the printer model to Army Headquarters in Washington.&rdquo;
Nothing could have pleased his father more!</p>
<p>In February of 1944, Edward E. Kleinschmidt demonstrated a working
model of his teleprinter in Washington at the office of the Chief Signal
Officer. Officials of the Signal Corps were greatly interested in the unit,
not only because of its extreme lightness and small bulk, but because
of the representations that the basic design features of this tape printer,
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
exclusive of the printing mechanism, could be incorporated in a page-type
printer which could be constructed with a total weight of approximately
thirty pounds. The machine was subsequently informally tested
at the Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories and found to have excellent
margins when working without an intermediate relay on very low line
current, a highly desirable feature in a piece of tactical teletypewriter
equipment.</p>
<p>The exhibit at Headquarters was successful, and after operative tests
at the Signal Corps&rsquo; Coles Signal Laboratories in Red Bank, New Jersey,
where approval for further studies was given, the Kleinschmidt organization
was asked to prepare plans toward a tactical light-weight printer
for field use.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that teletypewriters at that time were heavy,
cumbersome, and intended for use only at telegraph offices or at other
plant or office fixed installations.</p>
<p>The plans for a light-weight page printer were submitted to the Signal
Corps as requested and were well received by their engineers. These
engineers then wrote up specifications detailing their requirements for a
rugged, light-weight portable set for hand-carrying through jungles and
swamps, and operable under severe climatic conditions; the specifications
were submitted to the Teletype Corporation, the Western Union Telegraph
Company, and to the Kleinschmidt organization. Western Union
did not take on the development job, but Teletype and Kleinschmidt
accepted. A contract for the development of a teletypewriter according
to Signal Corps specifications was closed with both companies in 1945.</p>
<p>The Kleinschmidt Laboratories were not in active operation at this
time, so the first development contract was closed with the B. L. Kleinschmidt
Company which was fully equipped to carry on the work. Expert
tool and model makers were in his employ, some of whom turned out
to do well at the drawing board and were of great help in working out
mechanical functions. As a matter of fact, five or six of Bernard&rsquo;s employees
are still with the Kleinschmidt Division of SCM Corporation
at this writing, some having attained supervisory positions.</p>
<p>Edward F. joined his father in further engineering and development
work, and models of a typebar page printer and a typewheel page printer
to operate at 60 words per minute were built. Upon evaluation by the
Signal Corps and Army engineers, a printer with a higher operating
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
speed, up to 100 words per minute, was demanded. This new requirement
meant a complete redesign of apparatus, but it was successfully
carried through and experimental models were submitted by both companies.
Thereupon both Kleinschmidt and Teletype were asked to build
ten printers for field tests. This was done, and after extensive field testing,
the Kleinschmidt-designed, keyboard-operated, 100-words-per-minute
typebar page printer was accepted, and, by order of the then Secretary of
War, it was made the standard for the Military, effective on January 1,
1949. (This printer was later to be known as the TT-4 tactical page
printer, the principal component of Teletypewriter Set AN/PGC-1.)
(See <a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>.)</p>
<p>An announcement from the Department of the Army, in a document
released for publication on February 13, 1949,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="center"><i>Portable Teletypewriter Developed by Signal Corps</i></span></p>
<p>Portable teletypewriter equipment so light that a parachutist can carry
it on a jump from an airplane has been developed and adopted by the Army,
promising a major advancement in military communications, the Signal
Corps announced today.</p>
<p>Weighing but 45 pounds, compared with current field equipment that
weighs 225 pounds, the new portable teletypewriter is but one-fourth the
size of the old, has 300 fewer parts, is considerably stronger and consequently
requires far less maintenance. The new equipment is capable of
transmitting and receiving messages 66 per cent faster than existing types
and will operate on both wire and radio circuits. It is waterproof and should
it be used in amphibious operations, could be floated onto a beach.</p>
<p>The development is the fruition of a 20-year-old project that did not get
under way in earnest, however, until World War II was nearly over.</p>
<p>Because of its light weight, the new teletypewriter can be used much
closer to the front lines than has been the case. During World War II,
teletyped messages could go only as far forward as a division headquarters.
How much farther forward the new equipment can be used, will be determined
in forthcoming field tests.</p>
<p>The portable teletypewriter was developed by the Signal Corps Engineering
Laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, through a research and
development contract with Kleinschmidt Laboratories, Incorporated, of
Highland Park, Illinois.</p>
<p>There are three components to a complete field unit: the teletypewriter
itself, weighing 45 pounds; a power unit, and a case of accessories. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
three together weigh 116 pounds. All units are waterproof, both to permit
flotation in amphibious activities and to provide complete protection from
weather. One man can carry the teletypewriter itself, while two men can
carry all three units.</p>
<p>The field teletypewriter in current use weighs 225 pounds and&mdash;if a
vehicle is not available&mdash;requires four men to carry it. With power unit and
accessories, present field equipment totals more than 400 pounds and
requires seven men to carry it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While development work for the Signal Corps was progressing, Bernard
kept busy managing general operations and Edward F. took hold
in the general design and devised important features that were patented
in his name.</p>
<p>Bernard died in March, 1948. However, development work went
along with the B. L. Kleinschmidt facilities until 1949, when a production
order for 2,000 teleprinters, conforming to the now approved Kleinschmidt
design, was to be placed. Now that Bernard was no longer there to take
over business details, and as a certain amount of basic capital was needed
to operate a production establishment, arrangements were made to transfer
Bernard&rsquo;s equipment to Kleinschmidt Laboratories which thereafter
closed a contract to manufacture the required quantity of teleprinters now
designated as the TT-4 telegraph typewriter.</p>
<p>Kleinschmidt senior, now seventy-four, was not eager to take over the
management of production activities, and while manufacturers in the
office equipment and radio field were ready and anxious to take on the
manufacture of these new teleprinters, he sought to keep the future of
this new development with the Kleinschmidt Laboratories&mdash;now owned
by all members of his family. His son-in-law, Emerson E. (Bud) Mead,
was operating a manufacturing plant, producing electrical control devices
quite successfully, so, &ldquo;Why not ask Bud, then Secretary of Kleinschmidt
Laboratories, to take over? He could no doubt sell the Mead company at
a profit.&rdquo; Bud did find a buyer for his company and he was then made
vice president of Kleinschmidt Laboratories; later, when Edward E. Kleinschmidt
turned over full management to him, Mead became executive
vice president.</p>
<p>The immediate problem at the Laboratories was to find manufacturing
space. The first thought was to rent, but then there would be no room
to expand should larger orders follow, and this could be expected since
Kleinschmidt teleprinter apparatus was now made standard equipment
for all U.S. Armed Services. Upon further investigation, Bud Mead
found a plot in Deerfield, Illinois, facing County Line Road, consisting
of thirteen acres, which could be purchased at a reasonable price. This
area would give plenty of building room and space for parking cars.
Kleinschmidt Laboratories&rsquo; first building, 200 &times; 150 feet, was soon erected.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Preliminary work toward manufacturing, drawings, ordering of production
machinery, special tools, standard parts, and other items was carried
on at the Braeside laboratory.</p>
<p>The efforts of all of the people of the Kleinschmidt organization,
working with great enthusiasm and wonderful cooperation, sometimes
around the clock, were rewarded when on April 17, 1950, preproduction
samples of light-weight teletypewriter sets were delivered on schedule to
the Signal Corps in Fort Monmouth for approval and acceptance. Immediately
upon receipt of their approval, production began on the contract
awarded in June of 1949.</p>
<p>Kleinschmidt Laboratories subsequently received contracts and built
thousands of their teleprinters, including the filling of orders for the
AN/FGC-20 fixed station teleprinters (see <a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>).</p>
<p>Later, the Laboratories, together with the Automatic Electric Company,
then of Chicago, now of Northlake, Ill., designed and built switching
apparatus and set up high-speed, 100-words-per-minute, automatic teleprinter
switching centers for the Military. These systems had trunk
switching controls located at key distributing points in the United States
and abroad, interconnected by microwave circuitry.</p>
<p>As further orders for teleprinters and associated equipment came along,
manufacturing facilities were expanded into more building area; additions
to the first unit brought that building to 200 &times; 500 feet. Another building,
250 &times; 350 feet, of special design to house belt-line apparatus assembly
and parts storage, also testing, inspection, and shipping, was erected in
1958.</p>
<p>In August, 1956, Kleinschmidt Laboratories merged with Smith-Corona
Inc., on an exchange-of-shares basis, which eventually gave
Kleinschmidt Laboratories&rsquo; shareholders 60 shares of Smith-Corona (later
Smith-Corona Marchant Inc., and then SCM Corporation) stock for one
share of Kleinschmidt Laboratories&rsquo;. Bud Mead was elected a director
and a member of the executive committee. Later, he became vice president
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
of operations. When Smith-Corona merged with Marchant Calculators,
Inc. (June, 1958), he was made executive vice president; then,
in October of 1960, he was named president of Smith-Corona Marchant
Inc. (now known as SCM Corporation).</p>
<p>Kleinschmidt, as a Division of SCM Corporation, continues to supply
the Military and also commercial users with teleprinter equipment. The
conclusion of this chapter tells briefly the direction the Kleinschmidt
Division is going in the printed communications field.</p>
<p>Before the Kleinschmidt 100-words-per-minute teleprinter was put into
service on intercommunicating circuits, the operating speed on standard
circuits had been limited to 60 words per minute. Noting this important
change in operating speed, other manufacturers had to redesign their
teleprinter equipment to meet the new 100-words-per-minute speed.</p>
<p>Teletype Corporation came up with a new design, the No. 28, in which
all the type pallets are moveably mounted in a rectangular box that is positioned
to move a selected type pallet into printing position by a system
of levers operated in aggregate motions under control of the code selecting
mechanisms (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>). When so positioned, a print hammer strikes the
type pallet to print the character.</p>
<p>Creed, in England, later brought out a new design, their No. 75, using
a segmented typewheel having four rows of type faces. The typewheel
is set in the selected printing position by a lever and linkage system
operating in aggregate motion under control of the code selecting mechanism.
To print the selected character, the typewheel is struck against
the printing paper (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>).</p>
<p>Siemens and Halske, in Germany, produced their No. 100, a redesign
of the No. 15 Teletype, using lighter and faster moving parts for operation
at 100 words per minute. Among other improved features were a
type bar shift to replace the platen shift for printing letters or figures,
and a two-color ribbon which is automatically shifted to print in red or
black to distinguish between sent and received messages&mdash;a feature of
convenience in TELEX communication. The Siemens No. 100 was
designed especially for the TELEX system, operating at 66 words per
minute, where it is used extensively (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>).</p>

<p>The Kleinschmidt printer, designed to operate at 100 to 150 words a
minute, employs a new method for operating a typebar printing mechanism,
comprising a type basket movable across the printed page and
carrying the required set of type bars. Each type bar has a connected
push rod extending to the rear of the type basket and is made operative
to cause printing when a rotating finger, selectively positioned by a coded
stop cage, is struck against the push rod. To meet the requirements of the
Military for a teleprinter operable in any angular position, the letter
spacing and carriage return with deceleration to the stop position is under
positive control of the motor drive.</p>

AN/FGC-25 Send-Receive Fixed-Station Teletypewriter Set
(used by the Military)</p>
</div>
<p>In 1948, scientists at Bell Telephone Laboratories, engaged in semiconductor
research, announced the birth of their famous brainchild, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
transistor. Now the little transistor and his friends, the diode and advanced
techniques in electromagnetic inductive devices, have gradually
taken over in the communications field, permitting startling speed
increases and changes in equipment design.</p>
<p>In the 100-words-per-minute teletypewriters, the permutation code
equivalent of the character to be transmitted or received was at some
point &ldquo;set up&rdquo; mechanically by positioning levers or vanes. The inertial
properties of these mechanical parts placed low-level limitations on the
operating set-up speed. By using the binary code and electronic switching
circuits, the set-up time has been reduced from milliseconds to microseconds,
making higher speeds more easily obtainable. Also, electronic
approaches to printing on page or tape have contributed to the speed-up
of telegraph receiving devices. Now, both tape and page devices are
available at operating speeds up to 10,000 words per minute.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Bell System, also, is the development of Data-Phone
service, started in 1958. Data-Phone makes use of all the telephone
switching devices and repeating apparatus so that any type of communicating
system using frequencies within the voice range may be used.
For such systems the telephone company will install equipment to separate
the different types of electrical transmission to prevent interference. Because
Data-Phone enables not only the sound of the human voice to be
sent over a telephone circuit, but information from a teletypewriter or
business machine as well, this new use for the telephone system has
expanded its service to many types of business communications. At this
writing, the Bell System advertises, &ldquo;Data-Phone &lsquo;talks&rsquo; 16 times faster
than people talk. It can send punched card or taped data anywhere&mdash;at
speeds up to 2500 words per minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While these advances have been taking place, the transistor and its
companions have made a similar impact in the field of data processing.
The rapid evolution of computers and other high-speed switching devices
has generated a need for higher speed equipment to supply input and
output requirements. The changeover to electronics has realized minification,
lighter weight, reduction of mechanical parts with a corresponding
reduction in maintenance, quieter operation, and greater adaptability
to code and language conversion.</p>

<h3 id="c9">KLEINSCHMIDT DIVISION OF SCM CORPORATION</h3>
<p>At the Kleinschmidt Division where Mr. Emilio J. Cadamagnani,
Executive Vice President, is in charge, their engineering department,
under the supervision of Mr. Robert L. Kearney, is keeping up with the
change from electromechanically- to electronically-controlled devices.
Their new Model 311 Electronic Data Printer shown here is an example.
Operating at speeds from 60 to 400 words per minute and capable of
receiving 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-level code information in either serial or parallel
form, it is designed for use in high-speed communications or data
processing systems.</p>
<p>Also illustrated is still another new Kleinschmidt device, the Model
321 Automatic Data Set, which includes not only a page printer with
keyboard but a tape perforator and a tape reader, all compactly mounted
in a console.</p>
<p>Both the Model 311 and Model 321 are compatible with existing
data modems, conventional printing telegraph equipment, electronic
computers, and data processing equipment. This compatibility permits
their use in on-line or off-line communications and data-handling applications.</p>
<p>More exciting devices may be anticipated in the rapidly moving field
of printed communications.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
